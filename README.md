# odin-recipes
1st TOP project

The Odin Recipe is to put my knowledge and skills to practice by using HTML to create a recipe(s) of food. The project is to show how much i've attained and using what I know to accomplish the task. Finishing this project I was really able to build the HTML foundation by using lists(inorder/unordered), inserting images, linking relatively, and working with texts.

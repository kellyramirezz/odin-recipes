    <p>A <b>pupusa</b> is a thick griddle cake or flatbread from El Salvador and Honduras made with cornmeal or rice flour
        In <strong>El Salvador</strong>, it has been declared the national dish and has a specific day to celebrate it. It is usually 
        stuffed with one or more ingredients, which may include cheese (such as quesillo or cheese with loroco buds), chicharr√≥n, squash, or refried beans. 
        <i>It is typically accompanied by curtido (a spicy fermented cabbage slaw) and tomato salsa, and is traditionally eaten by hand.</i>
